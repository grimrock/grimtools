 grimtools - Legend of Grimrock 2 tools
========================================

This software is in extremely early stages of development. Please set your
expectations appropriately.

grimrock-convert - one day it will be able to convert LoG1 dungeons into LoG2 format.
  That goal is still far in the future. 
  
0.0.1 - Initial version. It is able to convert very small part of dungeon.lua. It
can convert mapName, playStream and mapDesc commands. mapDesc contains dungeon walls.
Those are converted. Nothing else is.
